read all args in map file

check if everything is there

translate map from infos to representation
place character
use raycasting to render walls, ceiling & floor

render texture on them

------------------------

BABY STEPS !!!!

need a function that'll get path from args of ./cub3D:
(w/ main->ac-av) (start w/ main, see for the rest later, BABY STEPS)
need to open and read file from path
	- if bad path return error message (specific function ?)
	- open w/ O_RDONLY
	- GNL :
		- each line must be checked
			- if line is good -> treat infos:
			- STRUCT
		- ignore empty lines as long as no map
		- check if map is closed
			-put map in char** | int** (char since NSEW)

----------------------------------

to find map

how to store lines ?
we don't know the size of the map

for each line you got, put it in char**
when last line is reached
	check for each '0' if they are surounded by either '1' or '0' or "NSEW"
		if not send ERROR
	if there is no "NSEW" return ERROR
	if everything is good print map to be sure;
