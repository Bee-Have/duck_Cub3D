read all args in map file

check if everything is there

translate map from infos to representation

use raycasting to render walls, ceiling & floor

render texture on them

------------------------

BABY STEPS !!!!

need a function that'll get path from args of ./cub3D:
(w/ main->ac-av) (start w/ main, see for the rest later, BABY STEPS)
need to open and read file from path
	- if bad path return error message (specific function ?)
	- open w/ O_RDONLY
	- GNL :
		- each line must be checked
			- if line is good -> treat infos:
			- STRUCT
		- ignore empty lines as long as no map
		- check if map is closed
			-put map in char** | int** (char since NSEW)
