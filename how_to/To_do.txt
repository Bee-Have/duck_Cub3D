STRUCTURE:
KO-define structure for code/file/folders
KO-define clear structs and what they contain
KO-implement parsing
KO-implement clean/clear mlx routine
KO-implement clean/clear keycode events

TESTING:
KO-move pxl_unit from img to mlx
OK-make pxlput same for everyone
	OK-add draw_pxl
OK-signify the front of the player
	OK-draw ray in front of him
	OK-test drawing ray with moving end point (ray drawing a circle basically)
	OK-make cicle instead of circle
	NOPE-(KO-maybe see how to change orientation of the square directly ?)
KO-make minimap able to be put anywhere on the image
	KO-Make function with : position, size ?
		KO-position should be "vague" : TOP_LEFT TOP_RIGHT BOTTOM_LEFT BOTTOM_RIGHT
			KO-translate "vague" position into automatic position stuck to side
			KO-calculate offset
	KO-make minimap resizable
		KO-establish "max" size for minimap (width, height can be different)
		KO-depending on size of map calculate new size
	KO-crop map around player ?

EVENT:
KO-make keycode event as bool pressed an unpressed (cant advance and rotate)
KO-left right of mouse is handled as right left arrows

KO-test raycasting
